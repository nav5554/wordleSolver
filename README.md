# wordleSolver
A java program to solve the daily wordle

HOW TO USE:
At the bottom of worlde.java, you will see various lines of code in the Main method, simply follow the comments and enter the corresponding character into the variables based on the result of each word entered into wordle. You will have to enter one word yourself into wordle, I reccomend "other," but you can use any word you like.

HOW IT WORKS:
In the repository there are two files, one for all the possible words that wordle accepts, and one for just the answers. The java program reads the lists and arrays that you filled and strips away the words that don't obey them.

BUGS:
Make sure in the "notInclCharacters" slot that even if a letter is dark, that doesn't mean it's not in the word, you may have guessed the letter earlier and it was correct, but it only occurs once in the word so wordle responds with a dark tile. 
 

Enjoy
