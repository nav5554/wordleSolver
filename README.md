# wordleSolver
A java program to solve the daily wordle

HOW TO USE:
Download the Zip file with all the necessary code and files. Keep all of the files in the same directory and run wordle.bat, a terminal will open up giving you further directions 

HOW IT WORKS:
In the repository there are two files, one for all the possible words that wordle accepts, and one for just the answers. The java program reads the lists and arrays that you filled and strips away the words that don't obey them as you provide it with more information
